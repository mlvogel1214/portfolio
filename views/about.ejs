            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Are you looking for a software developer who has a proven ability to pick up new skills quickly?</p>
            <p>Hi, Iâ€™m Michael Vogel. I have always had an interest in technology.  I recently made the decision to follow that passion and enroll in a coding bootcamp, which taught me full stack development in languages such as Python, JavaScript and Java.  I quickly picked up many skills, and learned how to apply them in many different aspects of software development depending on how they could best serve what I was attempting to accomplish.  Being successful in a coding bootcamp required me to pick up new languages in a short period of time while not skipping on the fundamentals. I am very excited to begin my career as a Software Developer and know I would be a huge benefit to any team.
